//! "apprt" is the "application runtime" package. This abstracts the
//! application runtime and lifecycle management such as creating windows,
//! getting user input (mouse/keyboard), etc.
//!
//! This fork keeps a native Win32 runtime for the application and a minimal
//! non-app/runtime split for library and wasm-specific artifacts.
//!
//! The goal is still to share as much of the core logic as possible while
//! keeping the user-facing application runtime Windows-native.
